You can choose between simple and advanced options. If you're completely new to blockchain and have never used an Ethereum wallet such as My Ether Wallet or Metamask, then you should choose Simple. Otherwise, choose Advanced. For this tutorial, we are going with simple.

Choose if you want to use Payment URLs or not. You can come back and enable these at a later date. For this tutorial, we can skip this for now.

### Skip Payments Urls

You are now done with the installation of the Yoroi wallet extension for Chrome and are ready to set up a new wallet to begin delegating to stake ADA on Yoroi.

### Creating Your Wallet

#### Choose Cardano
Yoroi is a Cardano Wallet app that is owned by Emurgo which has released its own token on the Cardano block chain. We will be focusing on Cardano wallets as these are the wallets that we can stake to and receive staking rewards with.

### Wallet Name & Password
The next window will be the main components of your wallet. Remember this password as it will be the password you use every time that you are to send ADA or when you allow delegation to a node pool.

### Agree and Continue to the Recovery Phase Step
We won't have screenshots of this step, but make sure to write down your recovery phrase and store it in a very safe place. You would not like to have forgotten your password and have no way to get back the access to your private keys. **THIS IS NOT MAGICAL**

![recovery phrase](https://01whimsy-storeage-space.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/article_images/yoroi/create_recovery_phrase.png)

Once you have passed the recovery phrase verification step go ahead and agree to the following disclaimers.

![disclaimers](https://01whimsy-storeage-space.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/article_images/yoroi/agree_to_understand.png)

**Your wallet is now created!**

You should now be looking at your dashboard.
At this point, you will need to send ADA to this wallet by clicking on **RECEIVE** from the top menu. You can't stake ADA on Yoroi if you don't have any ADA in your wallet.

![dashboard](https://01whimsy-storeage-space.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/article_images/yoroi/you_will_see_your_dashboard.png)

### Transfer ADA to your Wallet

It will give you a wallet address.

Use this address as the receiving address from the exchange where you are purchasing your ADA. You can also use the QR code to populate the payment address string. If you use the address above, thank you. It means you are sending the ADA to my address, and I'll gladly accept it as a donation. So please check to see that you are sending it to the correct address. You can reference the last 5 characters. Usually, they will be unique and should match the address you're using. Finally, you are ready to delegate and stake ADA on Yoroi.

![receive](https://01whimsy-storeage-space.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/article_images/yoroi/click_receive.png)

After sending your ADA to your new personal wallet your will see it here in your dashboard and can review the transactions in the transaction tab.

The next screen that will appear will confirm your delegation.

![confirm](https://01whimsy-storeage-space.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/article_images/yoroi/confirm_delegation.png)

In this process, I am delegating 10 ADA to the pool. There is a transaction fee of 2.174257 ADA for delegating. This is something to keep in mind if you're going to continuously switch from pool to pool. Type in your sending password which you created when creating your wallet and click delegate.

You have now successfully delegated your ADA to a stake pool using the Yoroi wallet! Stake ADA on Yoroi and earn rewards is that easy!
