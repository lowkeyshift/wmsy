# Whimsy Rewards Staking Project

We here at Whimsy ask the question, "Why does staking only have to be about ROA?". 

We would like to present "Project Whimsical Wonder".


## Monthly Prizes

These prizes will vary from month to month, but announcements for each prize will be announced through our community platforms.

Twitter: [@WMSYstakingpool](https://twitter.com/WMSYstakingpool)
Discord: [Whimsy [WMSY]](https://discord.gg/n2c3YcP4yh)

These prizes will consist of, but will not be limited to NFTs from popular projects, additional ADA air-drops and much, much more as
smart contracts enable additional support for amazing future monthly prizes.
