# Staking with Daedalus

Delegate ADA in a few quick steps using the official Daedalus wallet.

Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that it will download a copy of the entire Cardano blockchain to your computer. This ensures that you have a direct connection to the Cardano blockchain network and you won't suffer from third party network issues (although very rare) that might arise from using wallets such as Yoroi when there is high demand.

Staking your ADA to get rewards is the backbone of the Cardano network. The proof of stake protocol allows users to be rewarded in ADA for helping to validate blocks on the network, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum validate their networks with mining, rewarding miners in their respective tokens.

The process of staking is easy and has next to no risk in the process.

Users that are holding ADA can simply load a wallet using Daedalus or other popular Cardano wallets such as Yoroi, delegate ADA to a Stake Pool and receive rewards in the process.

Follow these easy steps to get started with delegating your ADA to a Stake Pool.

**Total Time**: 15 minutes

**First**, [download Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/) and create a wallet.

Ensure that you are downloading the Daedalus app from the official website.

If you haven't created a wallet before and transferred ADA to it, please follow our tutorial on creating a wallet in Daedalus. The process is quick and easy to do. Just ensure that you secure your passphrase when creating your wallet.

![search_results](https://01whimsy-storeage-space.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/article_images/daedalus/04_search_results.png)

In the search bar, type in the pool name (whimsy) that you want to delegate ADA to.

In this case, we are searching for **WMSY**, our ticker name for our Stake pool.

The slider bar can be used to match the size of your delegation and wallet to a suitable pool. Changing the size of your wallet will give you different options to delegate.

### Delegate ADA

1. Click the number and ticker of the pool to see more information about the pool and select "delegate" if you wish to delegate ADA to that pool.

Keep in mind, that each time you delegate ADA to a pool, there is a small fee to start delegating to a pool or swapping from one to another. This fee is generally **0.178 ADA**.

5. Now enter your wallet password and click confirm. You are now delegating ADA to the **WMSY** staking pool.

It takes a minimum of **15 days (3 Cardano epochs)** + the time till the end of the epoch (epoch duration is 5 days). So in short it should take between 15 and 20 days.
